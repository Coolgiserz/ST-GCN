# STGCN-Collections
This repos intergrate the popular models for spatail-temporal prediction, such as:
- ST-GCN
- Graph-WaveNet

PyTorch implementation of the spatio-temporal graph convolutional network proposed in [Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks: A Deep Learning Framework for Traffic Forecasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.04875) by Bing Yu, Haoteng Yin, Zhanxing Zhu. An example for traffic forecasting is included in this repository.
